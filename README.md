# Redesta
Redesta is a funding platform that uses a peer-by-peer review system that is innovative and provides financial incentives to the funders, while ensuring that the funds are used for the right purposes. At the same time, Redesta was written in a hackathon organized by Akbank and ReFi Turkey within 48 hours.
